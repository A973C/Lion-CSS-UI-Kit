Since the kit is for prototyping Lion apps, it's mainly made for webkit.

Copy & paste is your friend. I tried to keep the html as simple as possibble and avoid using any javascript for basic interactivity on the components. The selection in lists and segmented controls is handled with radio buttons. Disclosure triangles are checkboxes styled using -webkit-appearance: none;

Most of the styles are not tied to any context, so you can just apply a class to style an element in any way you wish. The classes are named after the actual component names in Xcode.
